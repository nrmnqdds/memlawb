**Open-source, self-hostable, zero-knowledge agent memory.**
The memory layer of the agent stack — give any agent durable memory it can
carry across sessions, stored on a server that *cannot read it*.

> Part of the [Gitlawb](https://gitlawb.com) stack: opengateway (inference) ·
> node (code) · openclaude (agent) · **memlawb (memory)**.

---

## Why

Agents forget everything between sessions. The existing fix — syncing memory to
a vendor's cloud — means a third party can read everything your agent learns
about you and your code. memlawb is the alternative:

- **Zero-knowledge.** Memory is encrypted on your machine before upload. The
  server stores and serves only ciphertext (AES-256-GCM, key derived from your
  passphrase). We host it but we cannot read it.
- **Self-hostable.** One binary, pluggable storage (filesystem, S3/Tigris/R2,
  more coming). Run it on our cloud or your own.
- **Provider-neutral.** A built-in **MCP server** gives Claude Code, Cursor,
  opencode, and SDK agents memory tools (`memory_save`/`recall`/`search`/
  `list`/`delete`); a simple sync API any agent can speak is underneath.
- **Delta sync.** Deterministic encryption means only changed entries upload,
  even though the server never sees plaintext.
- **Secret-aware.** A client-side scanner refuses to upload entries that look
  like they contain live credentials — before they're ever encrypted or sent.

## How it works

```
agent / CLI / MCP
   │   plaintext in, plaintext out
   ▼  [ client/crypto.ts — encrypt with key derived from your passphrase ]
   │   ciphertext
   ▼
memlawb server  (crypto-blind — only ever sees ciphertext)
   ▼
BlobStore: fs | s3 (Tigris/R2/AWS) | ipfs/git (planned)
```

The server is **crypto-blind**: it does delta sync, dedup, and storage entirely
over ciphertext. The encryption key never leaves the client.

## Quick start (self-host)

The server runs in Docker; the CLI is a plain HTTP client that stays on your
host (`bin/memlawb.ts` isn't even built into the image) and talks to whatever
`MEMLAWB_URL` you point it at.

```bash
# 1. mint yourself a static API key and put it in .env (owner:key pairs)
echo "STATIC_API_KEYS=me:mk_live_$(openssl rand -hex 16)" >> .env

# 2. build + run the server — ./data is bind-mounted so memory survives
#    `docker compose down` / rebuilds; without it, storage is ephemeral.
docker compose up -d --build

# 3. sync a memory directory, end-to-end encrypted (host-side)
bun install
export MEMLAWB_URL=http://localhost:8080
export MEMLAWB_API_KEY='mk_live_...'   # the key you put in .env above
export MEMLAWB_PASSPHRASE='your-zero-knowledge-passphrase'   # never sent to the server

bun run bin/memlawb.ts push ./my-memories user:me   # encrypt + upload
bun run bin/memlawb.ts pull ./restored      user:me   # download + decrypt
```

> The owner in `STATIC_API_KEYS` gates which namespaces that key can reach: a
> key minted for owner `me` can only touch `user:me` and `user:me/...` — never
> another owner's namespace (`src/auth.ts` `authorizeNamespace`). Keep the
> namespace argument's `user:<owner>` segment matching the key you're using.
>
> `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=true` (mapping every request to one implicit owner,
> `local`) exists for a throwaway local sandbox only — don't put it in `.env`
> for anything you'd mind losing to an unauthenticated request.

What lands on the server is ciphertext — `grep` your data dir for any plaintext
and you'll find nothing.

> ⚠️ **Zero-knowledge means no recovery.** If you lose your passphrase, the host
> cannot help you — the data is unreadable to everyone but the key holder. Back
> up your passphrase.

## Use as a library

```ts
import { MemlawbClient } from '@gitlawb/memlawb'

const memory = new MemlawbClient({
  url: 'https://memory.gitlawb.com',
  apiKey: process.env.MEMLAWB_API_KEY,
  passphrase: process.env.MEMLAWB_PASSPHRASE, // stays local
})

await memory.push('user:me', { 'MEMORY.md': '# what I know about the user...' })
const { entries } = await memory.pull('user:me')
```

## Use from any agent (MCP)

memlawb ships an MCP server in the same package, so any MCP-capable agent gets
durable encrypted memory by adding one config block. Add to your client's MCP
config (Claude Code shown):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memlawb": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@gitlawb/memlawb", "mcp"],
      "env": {
        "MEMLAWB_URL": "https://memory.gitlawb.com",
        "MEMLAWB_API_KEY": "mk_live_...",
        "MEMLAWB_PASSPHRASE": "your-zero-knowledge-passphrase",
        "MEMLAWB_NAMESPACE": "user:me"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The MCP server runs **locally**, holds the passphrase, and encrypts/decrypts
in-process — so the remote server still only ever sees ciphertext. Tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `memory_save(key, content)` | persist a durable fact |
| `memory_recall(query)` | rank stored memories by relevance (local) |
| `memory_search(query)` | literal keyword/substring search |
| `memory_list()` | list entry keys |
| `memory_delete(key)` | remove an entry |

For self-host, omit `MEMLAWB_API_KEY` and point `MEMLAWB_URL` at your server.

### Teaching the agent to use memory

Tools alone don't make an agent use memory well — it needs the *discipline*
(recall before answering, save only durable facts, don't duplicate). That lives
in one place, [`skills/memlawb-memory/SKILL.md`](./skills/memlawb-memory/SKILL.md):

- **Claude Code:** install it as a skill (drop the folder in your skills dir) and
  the agent reads it when memory is relevant.
- **Any MCP client:** the server exposes the same text as the `memory_guide`
  prompt and a short version in its startup `instructions`, so Cursor / opencode
  / SDK agents get the protocol without a separate file.

## API

All bodies are ciphertext; the server validates sizes/hashes without decrypting.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET`  | `/health` | liveness + active store |
| `GET`  | `/api/memory/:ns` | full data (ciphertext entries + checksums) |
| `GET`  | `/api/memory/:ns?view=hashes` | per-key checksums only (for delta) |
| `PUT`  | `/api/memory/:ns` | delta upsert `{ entries, deletions? }` |
| `DELETE` | `/api/memory/:ns?key=<entryKey>` | remove one entry |

A *namespace* (`user:me`, `repo:owner/name`, `agent:intern`) is the unit of
scoping. Entry keys mirror the memdir layout (`MEMORY.md`, `feedback/x.md`).

## Configuration

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example). Key knobs: `STORE` (`fs`|`s3`),
`ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED`, `STATIC_API_KEYS` / Supabase auth, and per-namespace
size/count limits.

## Security model

- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM; key = `scrypt(passphrase, salt=sha256("memlawb:"+namespace))`.
- **Integrity:** the entry key is GCM additional-authenticated-data, so a blob
  is bound to its key and can't be swapped or replayed.
- **Determinism:** synthetic-IV nonce enables delta sync; the only leak is
  whether two entries are byte-identical.
- **Defense in depth:** a client-side secret scanner runs before encryption and
  (by default) blocks uploads containing live-looking credentials. Override with
  `MEMLAWB_SCAN=warn|off`.
- **Tenancy:** each API key maps to an owner who controls exactly their own
  `user:<owner>` namespace subtree (strict segment match, no substring escapes);
  per-account quotas and per-owner rate limits are enforced server-side.
- **Upgrade path:** a version byte on every blob allows migrating to
  XChaCha20-Poly1305 + Argon2id without breaking existing data.

See [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) for the full roadmap (MCP server, openclaude drop-in,
git-backed signed history, sharing/forking, billing).

## Status

**Beta.** The crypto-blind server, client crypto, CLI, MCP server, secret
scanner, per-account quotas, and rate limiting are implemented and tested
(`bun test` — 50 tests). Hosted free beta at `memory.gitlawb.com`. Next:
self-service console for API keys, the openclaude native drop-in, and the
Postgres index for horizontal scale (the hosted beta runs a single machine
deliberately — see [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) §7).

## Development

```bash
bun install
bun test            # run the suite
bun run type-check  # tsc --noEmit
bun run check       # biome lint + format check
```

For contributors, the codebase splits cleanly along the trust boundary:

```
client/   the zero-knowledge client — encrypts here; holds the key
src/      the crypto-blind server — only ever sees ciphertext
src/mcp/  the MCP server (memory tools) over the client
bin/      the CLI (push | pull | mcp | serve)
```

The cardinal rule: **plaintext, passphrases, and derived keys never reach the
server.** See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full guide.
